# Electropgysiology data processing and event-related time series analyses and visualizations.

All pipelines are designed to work on data batch preprocessed from the included Neuroexplorer scripts and templates found in NEX_py_scripts and NEX_templates, respectively

These include peri-event local field potential time x freq x power and power spectral density analyses, with select comparison of power changes at an event-related frequency, peri-event multiunit spiking frequency time series analyses with group comparisons for event-related changes in spike frequency, and peri-event single spike analyses to qualitatively compare event-related response profiles and validate manipulations.
